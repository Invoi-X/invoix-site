    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <p class="updated">Last updated: February 20, 2026</p>

    <h2>1. Acceptance</h2>
    <p>By using Invoi.Xyz (the "Service"), including the desktop application, web app, and any related services, you agree to these terms. If you don't agree, please don't use the Service.</p>

    <h2>2. The Service</h2>
    <p>Invoi.Xyz is an invoice generator available as a desktop application and web app. The free tier includes core invoicing features with a watermark on exported PDFs and access to two templates. The paid desktop licence unlocks all templates, removes the watermark, and grants access to premium features.</p>
    <p>We reserve the right to modify, update, or discontinue features of the free or paid tiers at any time. We will make reasonable efforts to notify users of material changes.</p>

    <h2>3. Accounts</h2>
    <p>Web app accounts are managed through Supabase authentication. You are responsible for keeping your login credentials secure and for all activity that occurs under your account. Desktop app users do not require an account for core functionality.</p>
    <p>You must provide accurate information when creating an account. We reserve the right to suspend or terminate accounts that violate these terms.</p>

    <h2>4. Licence</h2>
    <p><strong>Free tier:</strong> We grant you a free, non-exclusive, non-transferable licence to use the Service for personal and commercial invoicing purposes, subject to the limitations of the free tier (watermarked PDFs, limited templates).</p>
    <p><strong>Paid licence:</strong> Upon purchase, we grant you a perpetual, non-exclusive, non-transferable licence to use the full desktop application. The licence is for your personal or business use and may be activated on your devices. Licence keys may not be resold, shared, or distributed.</p>
    <p>All licences are subject to compliance with these terms. We reserve the right to revoke licences obtained through fraud, abuse, or violation of these terms.</p>

    <h2>5. Payments &amp; Refunds</h2>
    <p>Desktop licences are sold as one-time purchases through LemonSqueezy. All prices are listed in GBP and include applicable taxes where required by law.</p>
    <p>Refund requests are considered on a case-by-case basis within 7 days of purchase. To request a refund, contact us at <a href="mailto:hello@invoix.xyz">hello@invoix.xyz</a> with your order details. Refunds are issued at our discretion.</p>

    <h2>6. Your Data &amp; Content</h2>
    <p>You retain full ownership of all data you create with Invoi.Xyz — invoices, client records, business information, logos, and any other content. We do not claim any rights to your content.</p>
    <p>You are solely responsible for the accuracy, legality, and appropriateness of the invoices and content you create and send using the Service. This includes compliance with applicable tax laws, invoicing regulations, and business requirements in your jurisdiction.</p>

    <h2>7. Email Integration</h2>
    <p>The Service allows you to send invoices via Gmail or Outlook through OAuth-authenticated integrations. By using these features:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>You authorise us to send emails on your behalf using your connected email account.</li>
      <li>You are solely responsible for the content of emails sent through the Service.</li>
      <li>You agree not to use the email feature for spam, bulk messaging, or any purpose other than sending invoices and related business correspondence.</li>
      <li>We do not guarantee email deliverability. Emails may be filtered by recipient spam settings or provider policies.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You may disconnect email integrations at any time from Settings. Disconnecting immediately deletes your stored OAuth tokens from our servers.</p>

    <h2>8. Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>The Service, including its design, code, templates, branding, and documentation, is owned by Invoi.Xyz and protected by applicable intellectual property laws. You may not copy, modify, distribute, reverse-engineer, or create derivative works from the Service or its components.</p>
    <p>Invoice templates included in the Service are licensed for use within the Service only. You may not extract, redistribute, or sell the templates separately.</p>

    <h2>9. Acceptable Use</h2>
    <p>You agree not to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Use the Service for any illegal purpose or in violation of any applicable laws.</li>
      <li>Attempt to reverse-engineer, decompile, or disassemble the Service.</li>
      <li>Exploit, abuse, or overload the Service or its infrastructure.</li>
      <li>Circumvent licence restrictions, rate limits, or security measures.</li>
      <li>Use the Service to send fraudulent invoices or misrepresent financial obligations.</li>
      <li>Share, resell, or distribute licence keys.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>10. Availability &amp; Support</h2>
    <p>We aim to keep the web app and backend services available, but we do not guarantee 100% uptime. The Service may be temporarily unavailable for maintenance, updates, or due to circumstances beyond our control.</p>
    <p>The desktop app works offline and is not affected by server availability, except for features that require an internet connection (email sending, licence validation).</p>
    <p>Support is provided on a best-effort basis via email. We do not guarantee response times.</p>

    <h2>11. Indemnification</h2>
    <p>You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Invoi.Xyz, its owners, and contributors from any claims, damages, losses, or expenses (including legal fees) arising from your use of the Service, your content, invoices you create or send, or your violation of these terms.</p>

    <h2>12. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>The Service is provided "as is" and "as available" without warranties of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement.</p>
    <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, Invoi.Xyz shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, including but not limited to loss of data, revenue, profits, or business opportunities arising from the use of or inability to use the Service.</p>
    <p>Our total liability for any claim arising from the Service shall not exceed the amount you paid for your licence in the 12 months preceding the claim, or £30, whichever is greater.</p>
    <p>You are responsible for maintaining your own backups of all data created with the Service.</p>

    <h2>13. Termination</h2>
    <p>You may stop using the Service at any time. We may suspend or terminate your access to the Service if you violate these terms, with or without notice.</p>
    <p>Upon termination, your right to use the Service ceases. Data stored locally on your device remains yours. Server-side data (OAuth tokens, account info) will be deleted within 30 days of termination.</p>
    <p>Sections that by their nature should survive termination (Intellectual Property, Limitation of Liability, Indemnification, Governing Law) will continue to apply.</p>

    <h2>14. Governing Law</h2>
    <p>These terms are governed by the laws applicable in your jurisdiction. Any disputes will be resolved in accordance with the applicable local laws where you reside.</p>

    <h2>15. Changes</h2>
    <p>We may update these terms from time to time. Material changes will be communicated through the app or website. The "Last updated" date at the top reflects the most recent revision. Continued use of the Service after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated terms.</p>
