    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <p class="updated">Last updated: February 20, 2026</p>

    <h2>Acceptance</h2>
    <p>By using Invoi.Xyz (the "Service"), you agree to these terms. If you don't agree, please don't use the Service.</p>

    <h2>The Service</h2>
    <p>Invoi.Xyz is an invoice generator available as a desktop application and web app. The free tier includes basic features with a watermark on exported PDFs. The paid desktop licence unlocks all templates and removes the watermark.</p>

    <h2>Accounts</h2>
    <p>Web app accounts are managed through Supabase authentication. You are responsible for keeping your login credentials secure. Desktop app users do not need an account.</p>

    <h2>Payments & Refunds</h2>
    <p>Desktop licences are sold as one-time purchases through LemonSqueezy. Refund requests are handled on a case-by-case basis within 14 days of purchase. Contact us at <a href="mailto:hello@invoix.xyz">hello@invoix.xyz</a>.</p>

    <h2>Your Data</h2>
    <p>You own all data you create with Invoi.Xyz — invoices, client records, business information. We do not claim any rights to your content. See our <a href="/privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a> for details on how data is handled.</p>

    <h2>Acceptable Use</h2>
    <p>Don't use the Service for anything illegal. Don't attempt to reverse-engineer, exploit, or abuse the Service or its infrastructure.</p>

    <h2>Availability</h2>
    <p>We aim to keep the web app and backend services available, but we don't guarantee 100% uptime. The desktop app works offline and is not affected by server availability.</p>

    <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>Invoi.Xyz is provided "as is". We are not liable for any damages arising from the use of the Service, including but not limited to loss of data, revenue, or business opportunities. Always maintain your own backups.</p>

    <h2>Changes</h2>
    <p>We may update these terms from time to time. Continued use of the Service constitutes acceptance of the updated terms.</p>

    <h2>Contact</h2>
